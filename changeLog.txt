Summary of changes made to the project that deviated from the project plan:

Reducing number of plants and zombies:
The number of plants was reduced toreduce complexity, it was decided that a simpler functional program was more
important than attempting something too complex and not having anything to submit.
We had 2 types of zombies instead of 3 to show the levels of inheritance but still simpify the program

Grid:
After learning how to use the SFML library, we realised that the grid was not actually required for tracking the characters.
However, the grid was still used to implement the character logic and have a backup plan to create a turn based
game if the UI did not work. The grid was integral for our unit testing as we were then able to integrate the tested 
behaviours with the SFML files/library.
